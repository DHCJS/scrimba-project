The first Scrimba Project I created and deployed on Netlify.

Implement some animations, changing the original colour and adding background pictures.

Throughout this lesson, I’ve learned about:

•	Image alt texts

•	Flex child containers

•	Inheritance

•	Shorthands

•	Web-safe fonts

•	Color palettes
